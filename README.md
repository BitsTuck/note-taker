## Description

The Challenge for Module #11 asked us to modify back-end code to make provided front-end code functional. In order to be successful, the index page needed to link to a notes page, that would accept and store note data.

## Usage

To use this app, click on the deployment link. From the landing page, click on Get Started to be taken to the notes page. Type in your note title, and any additional notes you might have. The Save button will appear when there is content in both fields. Save the note, and refresh the page to see your note saved on the lefthand pane. If you click on the notes in the lefthand pane, they will appear (with all of your detail) on the right.


## Challenges

It is taking some time for my brain to understand that we are launching the index page and making the links function is something that we now do through express, not the methods we were using earlier in class. The file structure had me confused for a bit, but once my tutor pointed out my errors, everything started functioning smoothly. I tried to figure out the delete bonus, but couldn't quite make it work the way I wanted in time for submission.
